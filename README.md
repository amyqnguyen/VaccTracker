# VaccTracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Feature

This site is built as a platform for clinics and patients to coordinate the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine.

### Patients

Patients can register with their personal information through oAuth and securely provide their information to the clinic. Once they are notified that vaccines are available, they will be able to book an appointment to receive their vaccine.

### Clinics

Clinics can register and view a list of patients registered to receive the vaccine.
Once a shipment of vaccine arrives, the clinic can log this onto their dashboard and notify all patients on the waitlist.
