# VaccTracker

## Features

This web app is built as a platform for clinics to coordinate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines for the public.

### Technologies Used
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Typescript
* Deloyed on AWS EC2
* PostgreSQL
* Material UI
* OAuth 2.0

### Public

Patients can register with their personal information through oAuth and securely provide their information to the clinic. Once they are notified that vaccines are available, they will be able to book an appointment to receive their vaccine.

### Clinics

Clinics can register and view a list of patients registered to receive the vaccine. Once a shipment of vaccine arrives, the clinic can log this onto their dashboard. As vaccine availibility is added, clinics can send notifications to users on the vaccine waiting list based on vaccine priority group.
